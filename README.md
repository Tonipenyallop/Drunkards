# What I learnt
For this project, I have learnt how to design APIs as well as how to use gRPC. At first I was trying to use gRPC with Go since I was eager to challenge myself and finish this assignment. However, learning gRPC and Go simultaneously was really tough especially in limited time period. For that reason, after one week past from the day I started this project, I switched to use Node server and I have learnt how to use gRPC. Especially the type of gRPC Objects as well as how to write and build protobuffer code.
